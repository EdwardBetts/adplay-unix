Introduction
------------

Hey there!

This is just a quickly hacked player for Linux. It produces 44.1khz,
16-bit mono output on /dev/dsp. There are no command-line switches
yet, else than the filename to play. Formats are auto-detected. You
could try to change the output format, but you would have to change
the source for this (just altering #define's won't work).

To compile, have AdPlug library sources at hand. Edit makefile to tune
path information and first "make players", then "make".

I'm working on a fully fledged linux console AdPlay, though!
Stay tuned!
