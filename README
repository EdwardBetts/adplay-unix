Description
-----------
AdPlay/Linux is AdPlug's Linux console-based frontend.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries and/or programs are needed in order to compile this
program:

Library			Version
-------			-------
glibc				>= 2.1
adplug			>= 1.1

Installation
------------
To compile the program, do as normal user:

make

This should build the adplay executable.

To install, do as superuser:

make install

This places the executable into /usr/local/bin. You can modify the target path
by altering the makefile.

After that, you can do as normal user:

make clean

or even:

make distclean

to remove all files created at compile time or even eventually additional
created files.

If you later wish to uninstall AdPlay, you can do as superuser:

make uninstall

to remove the executable from /usr/local/bin.

Usage
-----
Start adplay with at least one file to be played as parameter and you should
be set. Additional commandline parameters are explained by typing:

adplay --help

That's all for now. A more detailed doc will follow when i get the time to
write one. Any help is greatly appreciated!
