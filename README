Introduction
------------
AdPlay/Linux is AdPlug's Linux console-based frontend.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries and/or programs are needed in order to compile this
program:

Library			Version
-------			-------
glibc				>= 2.1
pthread			>= 0.8
adplug			>= 1.1

Installation
------------
To compile the program, do as normal user:

make

This should build the adplay executable.

Copy the adplay executable somewhere suitable into your directory structure,
preferrably somewhere in your path, like /usr/local/bin. This should be done
automatically in future.

After that, you can do as normal user:

make clean

or even:

make distclean

to remove all files created at compile time or even eventually additional
created files.

Usage
-----
Start adplay with at least one file to be played as parameter and you should
be set. Additional commandline parameters are explained by typing:

adplay --help

That's all for now. I'll work out this doc more completely, when it's time to
make a release.
