AdPlay/UNIX - UNIX console-based OPL2 audio player
Copyright (C) 2001, 2002 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>

Description
-----------
AdPlay/UNIX is AdPlug's UNIX console-based frontend. AdPlug is a free,
universal OPL2 audio playback library. AdPlay/UNIX supports the full range
of AdPlug's file format playback features. Despite this, at the moment, only
emulated OPL2 output is supported by AdPlay/UNIX.

AdPlay/UNIX uses OSS-style /dev/dsp output, so you need a UNIX with OSS
compatible sound support. Linux and BSD fall into this category...

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries are needed in order to compile this program:

Library		Version
-------		-------
AdPlug		>= 1.1

Installation
------------
Please refer to the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

CVS
---
If you checked out from CVS, first run:

autoreconf --install

to generate the build cruft and get the configure script. You need recent
versions of autoconf, automake and libtool to do this.

Usage
-----
Start AdPlay/UNIX with at least one file to be played as parameter.
Additional commandline parameters are explained by typing:

adplay --help

Or by reading the man page. A more detailed doc will follow when i get the
time to write one. Any help is greatly appreciated!
