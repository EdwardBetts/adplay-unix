.TH ADPLAY 1 "October 7, 2002" "AdPlay/UNIX 1.2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
adplay \- UNIX console-based OPL2 audio player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B adplay
.RI "[OPTION]... FILE..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
AdPlay/UNIX is AdPlug's UNIX console-based frontend. It tries to play
back all given FILEs.
.PP
AdPlay/UNIX plays endlessly, if only one file is given. With multiple files,
it plays them in a sequence and exits after the last file. The same can
also be accomplished with only one file, by using the \fB-o\fP option.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBadplay\fP returns 0 on successful operation. 1 is returned otherwise.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-8, \-\-8bit
Use only 8-bit samples for playback.
.TP
.B \-\-16bit
Use only 16-bit samples for playback (default).
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-freq=FREQ
Set playback frequency to FREQ, in Hz. This is 44100Hz by default.
.TP
.B \-\-stereo
Use only stereo samples for playback. The sound stream is just doubled, no
further audio processing is done. This option is pretty useless unless you
have very obscure audio hardware that only accepts stereo streams. AdPlug
only generates mono streams because the OPL2 only generates mono sound.
.TP
.B \-\-mono
Use only mono samples for playback (default).
.TP
.B \-b \-\-buffer=SIZE
Set sound buffer size to SIZE samples. If you notice sound skipping with the
default setting, try a greater buffer size. Note that this is measured in
samples, not bytes! This is 512 samples by default.
.TP
.B \-d \-\-device=FILE
Set sound output device file to FILE. Right now, only OSS compatible devices
are supported. This is \fB/dev/dsp\fP by default.
.TP
.B \-i \-\-instruments
Display instrument names (if available).
.TP
.B \-r \-\-realtime
Display realtime playback information, while playing. This will display a
one-line status bar, containing essential playback information.
.TP
.B \-m \-\-message
Display the song message (if available).
.TP
.B \-s \-\-subsong=N
Play subsong number N, instead of the first subsong. Only useful for
file formats that support multiple subsongs.
.TP
.B \-o \-\-once
Play just once, don't loop. This will exit \fBadplay\fP after the song
ended. This is the default when multiple \fBFILEs\fP are given.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
