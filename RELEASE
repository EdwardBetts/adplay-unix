Release procedure
-----------------

Before release:

 * Ensure version numbers are correct in configure.ac, adplay.qpg, doc/adplay.1.
   They should already be set to the version number of the next release, but
   may need altering e.g. if an unplanned bugfix release is made.

 * Update file list in adplug.qpg

 * Update NEWS with changes since last release

 * Create new tag: `git tag v1.2.3` and `git push origin v1.2.3`

After release:

 * Update version numbers as above to match the "next" release.  This means the
   git code will always compile as the version number of the next release.
